3. Arithmetic showcase:
    * Especially for x-- or x++ operators
4. Simple Electros Calculator showcase + homework
    * Input and output to user
    * Basic arithmetic
    * Basic data types
    * If-else and switch statements
5. Printing star patterns
    * Loops
6. Header files explanation and showcase

Rewrite the area project but for 3d shapes

__Wednesday__

Flowcharts and pseudocode, random, arrays:

1. Quickly showcase flowcharts
    * 1 or 2 examples, convert to pseudocode and work through their outputs
2. Random explanation and showcase
2. Explanation on pointers and showcase
3. Showcase arrays by computing current through resistors in series vs parallel
    * Arrays (subscript notation vs pointer notation)
    * Loops
4.  Find final velocity based on acceleration and distance homework

__Thursday__

Pointers to pointers, 2d arrays, recursion:

1. Recap of memory and what pointers are
2. Printing and storing star patterns in an array showcase
3. Gopher project homework
4. Recursion explanation
    * Factorial
    * Binary search
5. Recursive fibonacci and loop homework

__Friday__

Structs, file IO

1. Explain structs in terms of memory and typedef
2. Complex number library showcase + homework
    * making structs and shorten name with typdef
    * access structs and struct pointers
3. Count how many times a letter occurs in a file, write to binary and text file showcase
4. Count how many time a number occurs in a text file, write to binary and text file homework
5. Read from a binary file using SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, SEEK_END showcase + homework

__Saturday__

Queues, stacks and trees
1. Explain what each one is visually
2. Short explanation of Big O
3. Boring Go Fish example
    * Stack and queue combined
4. Blackjack homework
5. Binary tree explanation (pre-, in-, postorder)
