## The Plan

__Tuesday__

Setup, arithmetic, data types, loops, functions:

1. Set up and run Hello World! in Code::Blocks
2. Quick explanation of memory
3. Arithmetic showcase:
    * Especially for x-- or x++ operators
4. Simple Electros Calculator showcase + homework
    * Input and output to user
    * Basic arithmetic
    * Basic data types
    * If-else and switch statements

Rewrite the area project but for 3d shapes

__Wednesday__

Flowcharts and pseudocode, random, arrays:

1. Quickly showcase flowcharts
    * 1 or 2 examples, convert to pseudocode and work through their outputs
2. Printing star patterns
    * Loops
3. Header files explanation
4. Random explanation and showcase
5. Showcase arrays by computing current through resistors in series vs parallel
    * Arrays (subscript notation vs pointer notation)
    * Loops
6. Explanation on pointers and showcase
7. Do series vs parallel resistors again but with pointer notation
8.  Find final velocity based on acceleration and distance homework

__Thursday__

Pointers to pointers, 2d arrays, recursion:

0. Header files explanation

1. Recap of memory and what pointers are
2. Printing and storing star patterns in an array
      * [Better explanation of pointers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ybLD6_2gKM)
4. Gopher project homework
   * Make a 2d array
   * everything should be a '.' except for a random cell should a 'G'
   * print out array to screen as a grid
5. Recursion explanation
    * Factorial
    * Binary search
6. Recursive fibonacci and loop homework
    * Recap the recursion stuff we did now
    * Try write them from scratch
    * [Recursive example video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngCos392W4w): only worry about the first example, the others are harder than we would get in the exam
    * [Recursion course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bum_19loj9A&list=PLBZBJbE_rGRV8D7XZ08LK6z-4zPoWzu5H): it'll go a bit advanced later in the series, so only worry about this video to understand the concept



__Friday__

Structs, file IO

1. Explain structs in terms of memory and typedef
2. Complex number library showcase + homework
    * making structs and shorten name with typdef
    * access structs and struct pointers
3. Explain strings that end in null character
3. Count how many times a letter occurs in a file, write to binary and text file showcase
4. Count how many time a number occurs in a text file, write to binary and text file homework
5. Read from a binary file using SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, SEEK_END showcase + homework

__Saturday__

Queues, stacks and trees
1. Explain what each one is visually
2. Short explanation of Big O
3. Linked list, stack and queue showcase
    * [Linked list explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6dOwBde7-M&pp=ygUMbGlua2VkIGxpc3Rz)
4. Binary tree explanation (pre-, in-, postorder)
5. Add to binary tree showcase
6. Sorting algorithms:
    * [Playlist of every sorting algorithm explained](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9xmBV_5YoZOZSbGAXAPIq1BeUf4j20pl)

GOOD LUCK!
